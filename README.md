# Lionfish-Classification-Model

Lionfish are one of the most dangerous invasive species in the world. This is why image classification AI is useful in the fight against Lionfish. For a cp468 final, we created a lionfish classification AI model with tensorflow and python, using a dataset from RoboFlow. Our graphs were produced with Tensorboard. Here is a result of our graph accuracy.
